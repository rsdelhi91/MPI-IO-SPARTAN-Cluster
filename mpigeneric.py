#
# Description: This code performs a word count on a large file (10GB)
# containing tweets from different users. The input for this code is
# the file_name and the search_word that the user wishes to locate.
# Following which, dependign on the configurations specified in the PBS
# script, either the sequential/ serial version or the parallel version
# of the code will be executed. 
#
#
# This code can be invoked from the command prompt using the following
# command:  
#
#  mpirun -np 1 python mpigeneric.py <file_name> <search_word>
#
# This command would execute the sequential version, for parallel, depending
# on the number of nodes required, we can set it in the PBS script and in
# order to specify the cores we set the number 1 to 4 (for 4 cores) or 8 
# (for 8 cores)
